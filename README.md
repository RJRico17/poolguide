## What is the Beginner and Intermediate Billiard Skill Guide
The Beginner and Intermediate Billiard Skill Guide is a document and video guide created to teach both beginning and intermediate skills to amateur players in a clear, thorough, and non-confusing way. For those who want to learn pool in order to connect with friends, learn a new discipline, or pursue the game as a professional. This document will serve as the first step, as well multiple progress propelling steps afterwards.

## Why was it created?
For RJ's ENGL&335 class and because he loves pool.
